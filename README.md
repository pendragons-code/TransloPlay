# What
This is a simple translation app!		
This requires an api key to build and this is in in-dev!        
Uses the translo API.       
The free tier only allows a limited number of calls. That's why my friend decided to give me his key to a project he is no longer working on.

# Note
This project needs you to have a translo API key.

# Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/pendragons-code/TransloPlay
cd TransloPlay
npm i
node .
```

# code quality
Probably really bad!

# new features:
```
[1] Detect language
[2] using html options so no need to memorise ISO-lang (639-1) and no need to check!
```
